        <h2>The Physics Behind the Simulator</h2>
        <p>
            The motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is governed by the <strong>Lorentz Force</strong>,
            given by the equation:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">F = q(E + v × B)</div>
        <p>
            Since we are assuming no electric field (<strong>E = 0</strong>), the equation simplifies to:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">F = q(v × B)</div>
        <p>
            In this simulation, <strong>q</strong> represents the charge of the particle in Coulombs, <strong>v</strong>
            represents the velocity of the particle in meters per second (m/s), and <strong>B</strong> represents the
            magnetic field in Tesla.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Lorentz Force is always perpendicular to the particle's velocity, causing the particle to follow a
            circular path. The radius of the circular motion depends on the particle's speed and the magnetic field
            strength. It is given by:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">r = (m × v) / (q × B)</div>
        <p>Here, <strong>m</strong> represents the mass of the particle.</p>

        <h3>Simulation Key:</h3>
        <p>
            The yellow dot represents the charged particle affected by the Lorentz Force. It moves in a circular path
            determined by the force, and its position is dynamically updated based on the equations of motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The red line represents the instantaneous velocity of the particle. The line is tangent to the circular
            path, and its direction changes continuously as the particle moves, reflecting the constant change in
            velocity direction due to the magnetic force.
